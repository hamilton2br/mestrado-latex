abstract = {Computer Forensic process consists of Preparation, Acquisition, Preservation, Examination and Analysis, and Reporting. With the booming of the virtualization technology and the popularity of virtual machines for end users to deal with daily works, the probability of using virtual machines for malicious purposes keeps increasing. In this paper we propose a methodology by using virtual forensics for malware analysis and network forensics. Traditional forensics is done by using physical data. When company has large storage data and virtual environment, it creates a problem for traditional forensic while acquiring data. This paper proposes challenges, tools to be used, forensic techniques to be used and how to acquire data from cloud. 2012 Pillay Engineering College.},

abstract = {This paper presents the theoretical foundation of computer forensics, concepts, stages of an investigation, procedures and tools used by experts to investigate a cybercrime. Also addresses the issue cloud computing, the concepts, features, models and providers. Finally, we show a case study to verify the contents of files available for cloud storage providers are changed during the process of uploading, storage, and downloading. For this study the following procedures were adopted: Literature to filter quality materials produced by leading professionals in review; After choosing literature, several searches were done on websites for additional information, such as articles published in international databases and conferences in the area; Survey of the main techniques and tools used by forensic experts to analyze data in digital crimes; For the case study three accounts were created at different providers of services (Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive), data were collected manually through a browser and client software, both running in a virtual machine. Finally, it was found that the process of performing the download of files does not affect the contents of the same, since the MD5 hash values of downloaded files were the same as the original files. Because the files were transferred from one storage location to another, the information date and time may be changed, but the content of the files remained intact.},

abstract = {One of the most important areas in the developing field of cloud computing is the way that investigators conduct researches in order to reveal the ways that a digital crime took place over the cloud. This area is known as cloud forensics. While great research on digital forensics has been carried out, the current digital forensic models and frameworks used to conduct a digital investigation don't meet the requirements and standards demanded in cloud forensics due to the nature and characteristics of cloud computing. In parallel, issues and challenges faced in traditional forensics are different to the ones of cloud forensics. This paper addresses the issues of the cloud forensics challenges identified from review conducted in the respective area and moves to a new model assigning the aforementioned challenges to stages. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract = {The advent of cloud computing has brought new challenges to digital forensics. To address these challenges, new approaches in conducting digital forensic are required. In this paper, challenges that are faced by digital forensic investigator when faced with cloud based incident scenes are presented. The presented challenges are obtained from survey articles that explore outstanding and future challenges in digital forensics in general. In this paper we zoom in into cloud forensics as it is the main focus of the paper. Based on the challenges brought to light by the considered survey articles, we present requirements that should be met by digital forensic systems that aim to investigate cloud environments. Existing architectures and implementations of digital forensic systems are evaluated based on these requirements. Through this evaluation, gaps that are left out by the evaluated architectures are brought to light.},

@article{Quick2014,
abstract = {A major challenge to digital forensic analysis is the ongoing growth in the volume of data seized and presented for analysis. This is a result of the continuing development of storage technology, including increased storage capacity in consumer devices and cloud storage services, and an increase in the number of devices seized per case. Consequently, this has led to increasing backlogs of evidence awaiting analysis, often many months to years, affecting even the largest digital forensic laboratories. Over the preceding years, there has been a variety of research undertaken in relation to the volume challenge. Solutions posed range from data mining, data reduction, increased processing power, distributed processing, artificial intelligence, and other innovative methods. This paper surveys the published research and the proposed solutions. It is concluded that there remains a need for further research with a focus on real world applicability of a method or methods to address the digital forensic data volume challenge.},

abstract = {We expose and explore technical and trust issues that arise in acquiring forensic evidence from infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing and analyze some strategies for addressing these challenges. First, we create a model to show the layers of trust required in the cloud. Second, we present the overarching context for a cloud forensic exam and analyze choices available to an examiner. Third, we provide for the first time an evaluation of popular forensic acquisition tools including Guidance EnCase and AccesData Forensic Toolkit, and show that they can successfully return volatile and non-volatile data from the cloud. We explain, however, that with those techniques judge and jury must accept a great deal of trust in the authenticity and integrity of the data from many layers of the cloud model. In addition, we explore four other solutions for acquisition - Trusted Platform Modules, the management plane, forensics-as-a-service, and legal solutions, which assume less trust but require more cooperation from the cloud service provider. Our work lays a foundation for future development of new acquisition methods for the cloud that will be trustworthy and forensically sound. Our work also helps forensic examiners, law enforcement, and the court evaluate confidence in evidence from the cloud. ?? 2012 Dykstra {\&} Sherman. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
