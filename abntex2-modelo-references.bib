abstract = {The widespread availability and extensive use of Internet across the world has caught attention of the criminals and digital crimes are occurring at an epidemic scale nowadays. The field of digital forensics is constantly evolving by employing new tools and technique to counter novel approaches employed by the criminals as well as to investigate the nature of the criminal activity and bring the culprits to justice. Traditionally, the static analysis was used to investigate the digital incidents. But due to advancement in technology and the fact that hackers are developing malware that do not leave footprint on the hard disk, the need for performing live digital forensic analysis in addition to the static analysis has become imperative. Live forensic analysis techniques have evolved during the last decade to analyses the memory content to get a better picture of the running application programmers, processes and active binaries. In this study, we look into different techniques of live analysis and critically review them by identifying their benefits and limitations. The key areas focused in this study pertain to virtualization, pagefile extraction and identifying the encryption keys.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is getting more and more attention from the information and communication technologies industry recently. Almost all the leading companies of the information area show their interesting and efforts on cloud computing and release services about cloud computing in succession. But if want to make it go further, we should pay more effort on security issues. Especially, the Internet environment now has become more and more unsecure. With the popularization of computers and intelligent devices, the number of crime on them has increased rapidly in last decades, and will be quicker on the cloud computing environment in future. No wall is wall in the world. We should enhance the cloud computing not only at the aspect of precaution, but also at the aspect of dealing with the security events to defend it from crime activities. In this paper, I propose a approach which using logs model to building a forensic-friendly system. Using this model we can quickly gather information from cloud computing for some kinds of forensic purpose. And this will decrease the complexity of those kinds of forensics. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Traditionally, incident responders and digital forensic examiners have predominantly relied on live response for volatile data acquisition. While this approach is popular, memory capacity has rapidly changed, making memory a valuable resource for digital investigation, by revealing not only running tasks, but also terminated and cached processes. This research presents the impact and the limitations of the conventional volatile forensic method, live response, in comparison to the alternative method, memory image analysis. The experiment's results demonstrate and we discuss the forensic effects of executing a live response toolkit, which alters the volatile data environment significantly in some cases and can overwrite potential evidence. Memory image analysis is also leveraged as an alternative approach that helps mitigate the risk of losing volatile evidence such as terminated and cashed processes, which are ignored during live response. This comparative analysis calls attention the capabilities of both methods in retrieving and recovering volatile data.},

Also addresses the issue cloud computing, the concepts, features, models and providers. Finally, we show a case study to verify the contents of files available for cloud storage providers are changed during the process of uploading, storage, and downloading. For this study the following procedures were adopted: Literature to filter quality materials produced by leading professionals in review; After choosing literature, several searches were done on websites for additional information, such as articles published in international databases and conferences in the area; Survey of the main techniques and tools used by forensic experts to analyze data in digital crimes; For the case study three accounts were created at different providers of services (Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive), data were collected manually through a browser and client software, both running in a virtual machine. Finally, it was found that the process of performing the download of files does not affect the contents of the same, since the MD5 hash values of downloaded files were the same as the original files. Because the files were transferred from one storage location to another, the information date and time may be changed, but the content of the files remained intact.},

This area is known as cloud forensics. While great research on digital forensics has been carried out, the current digital forensic models and frameworks used to conduct a digital investigation don't meet the requirements and standards demanded in cloud forensics due to the nature and characteristics of cloud computing. In parallel, issues and challenges faced in traditional forensics are different to the ones of cloud forensics.

abstract = {A major challenge to digital forensic analysis is the ongoing growth in the volume of data seized and presented for analysis. This is a result of the continuing development of storage technology, including increased storage capacity in consumer devices and cloud storage services, and an increase in the number of devices seized per case. Consequently, this has led to increasing backlogs of evidence awaiting analysis, often many months to years, affecting even the largest digital forensic laboratories. Over the preceding years, there has been a variety of research undertaken in relation to the volume challenge. Solutions posed range from data mining, data reduction, increased processing power, distributed processing, artificial intelligence, and other innovative methods. This paper surveys the published research and the proposed solutions. It is concluded that there remains a need for further research with a focus on real world applicability of a method or methods to address the digital forensic data volume challenge.},

abstract = {We expose and explore technical and trust issues that arise in acquiring forensic evidence from infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing and analyze some strategies for addressing these challenges. First, we create a model to show the layers of trust required in the cloud. Second, we present the overarching context for a cloud forensic exam and analyze choices available to an examiner. Third, we provide for the first time an evaluation of popular forensic acquisition tools including Guidance EnCase and AccesData Forensic Toolkit, and show that they can successfully return volatile and non-volatile data from the cloud. We explain, however, that with those techniques judge and jury must accept a great deal of trust in the authenticity and integrity of the data from many layers of the cloud model. In addition, we explore four other solutions for acquisition - Trusted Platform Modules, the management plane, forensics-as-a-service, and legal solutions, which assume less trust but require more cooperation from the cloud service provider. Our work lays a foundation for future development of new acquisition methods for the cloud that will be trustworthy and forensically sound. Our work also helps forensic examiners, law enforcement, and the court evaluate confidence in evidence from the cloud. ?? 2012 Dykstra {\&} Sherman. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Introspection has featured prominently in many recent security solutions, such as virtual machine-based intrusion detection, forensic memory analysis, and low-artifact malware analysis. Widespread adoption of these approaches, however, has been hampered by the semantic gap: in order to extract meaningful information about the current state of a virtual machine, detailed knowledge of the guest operating system's inner workings is required. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically creating introspection tools for security applications with minimal human effort. By analyzing dynamic traces of small, in-guest programs that compute the desired introspection information, we can produce new programs that retrieve the same information from outside the guest virtual machine. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques by automatically generating 17 programs that retrieve security information across 3 different operating systems, and show that their functionality is unaffected by the compromise of the guest system. Our technique allows introspection tools to be effortlessly generated for multiple platforms, and enables the development of rich introspection-based security applications.},

abstract = {Cloud Computing is arguably one of the most discussed information technologies today. It presents many promising technological and economical opportunities. However, many customers remain reluctant to move their business IT infrastructure completely to the cloud. One of their main concerns is Cloud Security and the threat of the unknown. Cloud Service Providers (CSP) encourage this perception by not letting their customers see what is behind their virtual curtain. A seldomly discussed, but in this regard highly relevant open issue is the ability to perform digital investigations. This continues to fuel insecurity on the sides of both providers and customers. Cloud Forensics constitutes a new and disruptive challenge for investigators. Due to the decentralized nature of data processing in the cloud, traditional approaches to evidence collection and recovery are no longer practical. This paper focuses on the technical aspects of digital forensics in distributed cloud environments. We contribute by assessing whether it is possible for the customer of cloud computing services to perform a traditional digital investigation from a technical point of view. Furthermore we discuss possible solutions and possible new methodologies helping customers to perform such investigations.},
